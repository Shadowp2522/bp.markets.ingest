**Hi**,

This was my first real experience with **AI**. While it's great for QA support and especially for documentation, there are a few important caveats to keep in mind:

**It's not authoritative**: Always rely on your own judgment. AI tends to over-document or over-explain.

**It can create extra work**: If you follow up on every suggestion—or use multiple engines—you may end up spending your whole day tweaking and optimizing.

**Use it wisely**: If you let it drive your processes, you'll **lose time** rather than save it.

**Use it for what it is**: AI is a tool built on statistical inference, which means it can be wrong.

**My personal take?** It's better than traditional Google search when you need quick solutions or specific information. If I need an SQL query to calculate an SMA, EMA, Bollinger Bands, or other indicators, it gives excellent results. Treat it like a search engine. The pitfall is that it often suggests too much—and it does so in a way that sounds very convincing and very reasonable.

**Always consider your end audience**. User first.

Have a great day!
